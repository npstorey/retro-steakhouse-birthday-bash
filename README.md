# Retro Steakhouse Birthday Bash Website

## Overview

This repository documents our creative journey in building a fake website for a themed 1982 steakhouse birthday party. We collaborated with large language models (LLMs) to craft an evocative backstory and generate detailed, multi-movement playlist tracklists that together form a seamless narrative of one epic night.

## The Backstory

Below is the full original story that inspired the first playlist:

> **A Night to Remember: The Legendary 1982 Steakhouse, House Party, and After-Party Journey**  
>  
> **6:30 PM – The Hip Steakhouse Vibe**  
> The night begins in the dimly lit, stylish interior of a steakhouse that feels like the cultural intersection of Wall Street excess, bohemian cool, and the birth of the downtown art scene. The air smells of seared ribeye and cigarette smoke. The decor is dark wood, chrome accents, and abstract paintings that nobody really understands but loves to stare at over their cocktails.  
>  
> At one table, a mix of yuppies, musicians, and artists sip whiskey sours and martinis while soaking in the music—a soundtrack of deep-cut new wave, funk, and smooth jazz. The steakhouse refuses to play the obvious hits, opting instead for the deep grooves and art-funk oddities that signal status and taste to those paying attention. Talking Heads, Prince, and Roxy Music pulse through the room alongside chic, obscure electro-funk tracks.  
>  
> The art students at one of the corner booths are already buzzed off of cocktails they can’t quite afford. They soak in the atmosphere—this is a hip place, the kind of scene that makes them feel like they’re in a movie about their own lives. But they’re restless. They don’t just want to be around cool—they want to make the night legendary. One of them knows about a house party.

>  
> **10:00 PM – The Wild House Party**  
> The cab ride uptown is a blur of cigarette smoke and neon lights. When they push open the door to the packed brownstone loft party, it’s already in full, chaotic swing.  
>  
> The DJ—probably a film school dropout with a serious vinyl addiction—isn’t playing anything obvious. The speakers throb with deep-cut electro-funk, post-disco boogie, and proto-house grooves. This isn’t mainstream club music, but it feels better. The rhythms are infectious, the basslines are elastic, and the vibe is electric. The art students—still dressed in their steakhouse-best—throw themselves onto the dancefloor, losing themselves in the strange, pulsating beats.  
>  
> There’s no real furniture—just mattresses on the floor, stacks of records against the walls, and a bathtub full of melting ice and cheap beer. A few punks are talking about how rock is dead while a guy in a suit insists that "computers are the future of music." Nobody knows who actually owns the place, but nobody cares.  
>  
> The DJ, a guy in a shiny blue suit who looks like he hasn’t slept in two days, cues up a deep cut Prince track. The room erupts. Everyone sings along, half-screaming, half-dancing. Someone breaks a glass. Someone kisses someone they shouldn’t. Someone whispers, “Let’s get out
